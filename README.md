Ukraine map data suitable for [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) visualizations.


## Getting Started

1. If you are new to D3.js, start with [Letâ€™s Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) tutorial by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).  It explains basic D3.js concepts and demonstrates how to make a map.

2. If you are familiar with D3.js, just grab `ukraine.json` and go ahead, create visualizations you want.
